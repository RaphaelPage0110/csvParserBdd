# csvParserBdd
`This parser allows to create two correct csv files from a kaggle dataset. Those csv files can then be used to import data on a database.`

The datasets can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new#CAvideos.csv
This dataset includes several months of data on daily trending YouTube videos. Data is included for the US, GB, DE, CA, and FR regions (USA, Great Britain, Germany, Canada, and France, respectively), with up to 200 listed trending videos per day.

The database populated with the files created by this parser will follow this diagram: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WjymatHcCoMObPhqWfvSYCfNsr_zZXsN
